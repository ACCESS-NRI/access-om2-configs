 The shallowest wet ocean model grid cell has depth (meters)     10.43281
 and this occurs at (i,j,k) = (846, 73,  7)
 which has (long,lat,depth) =  ( -195.4500,  -78.0674,    10.43281)

 Beware that shallow regions (e.g., those shallower than 50m) may be subject
 to numerical problems if strong surface forcing is not mixed vertically.
 Such problems may occur especially in shallow regions with kmt==2.
 Current speeds and/or tracer deviations may become large due to the deposition
 of wind and/or buoyancy over just a small upper ocean region. Such problems
 can be resolved by adding sufficient vertical mixing in these regions.
 Such happens in Nature due to tides and breaking surface waves.

description: "1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under the RYF9091 Repeat\nYear Forcing strategy outlined by Stewart et al. (2020), \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2019.101557.\nThe configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements and\ncoupled biogeochemistry in the ocean and sea ice.\nInitial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature and practical salinity\nand BGC tracers as in https://github.com/COSIMA/input_om2-bgc/tree/6aee4a4.\nRun with JRA55-do v1.4.0 RYF9091 (1 May 1990 - 30 April 1991) repeated forcing\nwith all solid runoff converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.\nSpin up starts from a nominal year of 1 Jan 1900."

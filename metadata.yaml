description: |-
  1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements.
  Initial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature and practical salinity.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.4.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  Spin up starts 1 Jan 1958 and runs to 1 Jan 2019.
notes: |-
  COSIMA request that users of this or other ACCESS-OM2 model code or output data:
  (a) add a project description to COSIMA's list:
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18BDyZlHTSy6EOaf_5o9CwGBOu4pBj88XsS2vNW4R_2o
  (b) consider citing Kiss et al. (2020) [http://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020] and papers describing relevant
  configuration updates - see https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/access-om2-control-experiments/258
  (c) include an acknowledgement such as that suggested here: https://cosima.org.au/index.php/get-involved/
  (d) let COSIMA know of any publications which use these models or data so they can add them to their list:

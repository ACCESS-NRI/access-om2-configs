description: |-
  0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements and
  coupled biogeochemistry in the ocean and sea ice.
  Initial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature and practical salinity
  and BGC tracers as in https://github.com/COSIMA/input_om2-bgc/tree/6aee4a4.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.4.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  Spin up starts 1 Jan 1958 and runs to 1 Jan 2019.

  COSIMA requests that users of this or other ACCESS-OM2 model code or output data:
  (a) consider citing Kiss et al. (2020) [http://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020]
  (b) include an acknowledgement such as the following:
  "The authors thank the Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia (COSIMA; http://www.cosima.org.au)
  for making the ACCESS-OM2 suite of models available at https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2.
  Model runs were undertaken with the assistance of resources from the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI),
  which is supported by the Australian Government."
  (c) let COSIMA know of any publications which use these models or data so they can add them to their list:

description: "0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under the RYF9091 Repeat\nYear Forcing strategy outlined by Stewart et al. (2020), \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2019.101557.\nThe configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements.\nInitial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature and practical salinity.\nRun with JRA55-do v1.4.0 RYF9091 (1 May 1990 - 30 April 1991) repeated forcing\nwith all solid runoff converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.\nSpin up starts from a nominal year of 1 Jan 1900."
notes: |-
  COSIMA request that users of this or other ACCESS-OM2 model code or output data:
  (a) consider citing Kiss et al. (2020) [http://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020]
  (b) include an acknowledgement such as the following:
  "The authors thank the Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia (COSIMA; http://www.cosima.org.au)
  for making the ACCESS-OM2 suite of models available at https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2.
  Model runs were undertaken with the assistance of resources from the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI),
  which is supported by the Australian Government."
  (c) let COSIMA know of any publications which use these models or data so they can add them to their list:

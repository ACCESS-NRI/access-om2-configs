  1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under the RYF9091 Repeat
  Year Forcing strategy outlined by Stewart et al. (2020), 
  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2019.101557.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements.
  Initial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature and practical salinity.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.4.0 RYF9091 (1 May 1990 - 30 April 1991) repeated forcing
  with all solid runoff converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  Spin up starts from a nominal year of 1 Jan 1900.

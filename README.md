# 01deg_jra55_iaf
Standard configuration for 0.1 degree [ACCESS-OM2](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2) experiment (ACCESS-OM2-01) with JRA55-do interannual forcing (IAF).

For usage instructions, see the [ACCESS-OM2 wiki](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2/wiki).

Run length and timestep are set in `accessom2.nml`. The configuration is supplied with a 300s timestep which is stable for a startup from rest, but very slow. **After the model has equilibrated for a few months you should increase the timestep to 450s and then to 540s** for improved throughput. You may even find it runs stably at 600s.

**NOTE:** All ACCESS-OM2 model components and configurations are undergoing continual improvement. We strongly recommend that you "watch" this repo (see button at top of screen; ask to be notified of all conversations) and also watch [ACCESS-OM2](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2), all the [component models](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2/tree/master/src), and [payu](https://github.com/payu-org/payu) to be kept informed of updates, problems and bug fixes as they arise.

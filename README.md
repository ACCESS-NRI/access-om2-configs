# 01deg_jra55_ryf
0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 experiment with JRA55 RYF atmospheric forcing.

This configuration is designed to run the default ACCESS-OM2-01 with the JRA55-v1.3 RYF9091 forcing.
Note that the default timestep for this run is 600 seconds, but you may need shorter timesteps during the first year of model equilibration.

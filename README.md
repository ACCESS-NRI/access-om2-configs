# 1deg_jra55_ryf
Standard configuration for 1 degree [ACCESS-OM2](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2) experiment (ACCESS-OM2-025) with JRA55-do 1 May 1990 - 30 April 1991 repeat-year forcing (RYF9091).

Note that the default timestep for this run is 5400 seconds, but you may need shorter timesteps during the first year of model equilibration.

**NOTE:** All ACCESS-OM2 model components and configurations are undergoing continual improvement. We strongly recommend that you "watch" this repo (see button at top of screen; ask to be notified of all conversations) and also watch [ACCESS-OM2](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2), all the [component models](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2/tree/master/src), and [payu](https://github.com/payu-org/payu) to be kept informed of updates, problems and bug fixes as they arise.

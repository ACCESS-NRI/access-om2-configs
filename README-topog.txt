/short/v45/aek156/access-om2/input/mom_01deg/topog_12_10_17_yenesei.nc is the same as 
/g/data3/hh5/tmp/cosima/bathymetry/topog_12_10_17_yenesei.nc 
and was used as topog.nc until the end of run 387 (Dec year 35) of 01deg_jra55v13_ryf8485_spinup6

However this had potholes and problems on Baffin Island and elsewhere
https://github.com/OceansAus/access-om2/issues/99

So from run 388 (Jan year 36) onwards 
/short/v45/aek156/access-om2/input/mom_01deg/topog.nc
was changed to a copy of this corrected topography
/g/data3/hh5/tmp/cosima/bathymetry/topog_13_06_2018.baffin.nc

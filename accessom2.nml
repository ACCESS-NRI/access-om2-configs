    ! ice_ocean_timestep defines the MOM baroclinic timestep, CICE thermodynamic timestep
    ! and MOM-CICE coupling interval, in seconds.
    ! ice_ocean_timestep is normally a factor of the JRA55-do forcing period of 3hr = 10800s,
    ! e.g. one of 100, 108, 120, 135, 144, 150, 180, 200, 216, 225, 240, 270, 300, 360, 400, 432,

    ! The model is usually stable with a 5400s timestep, including in the initial spinup from rest.
